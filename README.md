dotfiles
========

My personal config files.
With bits, pieces and snippets borrowed, stolen or scavenged from various sources across the net.
I have tried to credit the different authors were possible.

To use them, clone the git repo, edit  makesymlinks.sh to your liking and run the script to create the symlinks to
your dotfiles.
